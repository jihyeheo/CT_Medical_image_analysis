## 2nd_Week [20210427 ~ 20210512]

1) Data Transform [[Link]](https://github.com/jihyeheo/CT_Medical_image_analysis/tree/main/2nd_Week_Data_Transform)<br>
I changed the extension of the photo data to make it easier to apply noise, and also changed it to NumPy.

2) Apply Vanilla CNN [[Link]](https://github.com/jihyeheo/CT_Medical_image_analysis/tree/main/2nd_Week_Vanilla_CNN)<br> 
version1 is pytorch, version2 is tensorflow. <br>
The same model was applied to other frameworks.<br>
